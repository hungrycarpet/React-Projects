# Weather Application

The Weather Application is a sleek and user-friendly web application designed to provide you with accurate and up-to-date weather information. Built using the power of React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and JSX, this application offers a beautiful interface that allows users to obtain weather-related information for any desired location. The Weather Application provides essential information such as place, country, day and time, temperature, and overall weather conditions (e.g., haze, clouds, sunny). 

Users can input the name of the place they want to see the weather for, and the application queries the OpenWeatherMap API in the backend, reflecting the information in a visually appealing manner. Based on the weather of the searched place, the background of the web application changes to help the user get a better feel of the weather conditions.
